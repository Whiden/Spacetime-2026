## Epic 7: Contract System

### Story 7.1 — Contract Engine: Creation & Validation (2026-02-18)

**What changed:**
- Created `src/engine/actions/create-contract.ts` — pure engine function for contract creation and validation
- Created `src/__tests__/engine/actions/create-contract.test.ts` — 36 unit tests

**Functions implemented:**
- `createContract(params)`: validates all inputs and returns a new `Contract` object or a typed validation error
- `isCorpEligible(corp, contractType)`: checks corp type eligibility; cross-type allowed at level 3+ except specialized contracts; megacorp (level 6+) unrestricted
- `validateTarget(params)`: validates target type matches contract type, entity exists, and entity status is valid
- `calculateBpPerTurn(params)`: returns cost from contract definition; colonization defers to colony type definition
- `calculateDuration(params, corp)`: exploration scales with corp level (max(2, 4−floor(level/2))); colonization uses colony type duration; trade route sentinel 9999

**Validation error codes:**
- `CORP_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_TARGET_TYPE`, `TARGET_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_PLANET_STATUS`, `SECTORS_NOT_ADJACENT`, `CORP_NOT_ELIGIBLE`, `INSUFFICIENT_BP`, `MISSING_COLONY_TYPE`, `MISSING_SHIP_PARAMS`

**Key design decisions:**
- Colonization requires Accepted or GroundSurveyed status (not OrbitScanned)
- Ground survey accepts OrbitScanned or Accepted planets
- Cross-type (level 3+) does NOT apply to Colonization, ShipCommission, or TradeRoute — specialized only
- `sectorAdjacency` passed separately (Galaxy.adjacency map) since Sector itself has no adjacency field
- Trade route duration uses sentinel 9999 — contract store handles "ongoing until cancelled" (Story 17.1)
- Ship commission cost/duration are placeholders — full calculation deferred to Story 15.2

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- Validates contract type + target combination ✓
- Calculates BP/turn and duration based on contract type and corp level ✓
- Validates player has sufficient BP for at least first turn ✓
- Validates corp eligibility (correct type or level 3+ cross-type, level 6+ megacorp) ✓
- Returns new Contract object or validation error ✓
- Unit tests: valid creation, invalid target, insufficient BP, ineligible corp ✓
- `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` — zero TypeScript errors ✓
- `npx vitest run` — 261/261 tests pass ✓

## Epic 6: Corporations — Data Model & Lifecycle (Completed 2026-02-17)

Implemented corporation generation, capital system, store, and display (Stories 6.1-6.4). Built name generator (`generateCorpName` — prefix+suffix or prefix+connector+suffix, uniqueness registry, `clearNameRegistry()` for new games) and corp generator (`generateCorporation` — unique name, type from param or random, 1-2 traits with conflict exclusion: Cautious/Aggressive, Innovative/Conservative, Ethical/Ruthless, level 1, capital 0). Created capital formulas (`growth.ts` — `calculateCapitalGain`, `calculateCompletionBonus`, `calculateLevelUpCost`, `calculateAcquisitionCost`, `calculateMaxInfra`, `getTotalOwnedInfra`). Built corporation Pinia store (Map by ID; actions: `addCorporation`, `kickstartCorp`, `addCapital`, `spendCapital`, `levelUp`; getters: `getCorp`, `getCorpsByType`, `getCorpsByPlanet`, `getCorpTax`, `allCorporations`, `corpCount`; wired corp taxes into budget store). Built `CorporationsView.vue` (sorted by level descending, empty state), `CorpDetailView.vue` (two-column: stats+traits+capital left, assets+history+planets right), `CorpCard.vue` (color-coded type badge, level, capital, tax, infra bar, traits, home planet), `CorpAssets.vue` (infra holdings by colony), `CorpHistory.vue` (contract history placeholder — wired in Story 7.2).

**Key architecture decisions:**
- Level 1-2 corps show "Exempt" for tax (startup exemption)
- Corp type badges color-coded: amber=Exploitation, sky=Shipbuilding, violet=Science, etc.
- `getTotalOwnedInfra` helper sums all infra levels across all colonies for capital gain calculation

**Tests:** 225 passing (corp-generator: 23, growth: 28, prior: 174)

## Epic 5: Budget System (Completed 2026-02-17)

Implemented the BP economy (Stories 5.1-5.3). Built tax formulas (`calculatePlanetTax` using `floor(pop²/4) - habitability_cost` with pop < 5 returning 0; `calculateCorpTax` using `floor(corpLevel²/5)` with level 1-2 exemption). Created budget Pinia store (`budget.store.ts` — state: `currentBP`, itemized `incomeSources`/`expenseEntries`, `debtTokens`; actions: `calculateIncome()`, `addExpense()`, `applyDebt()` with `floor(deficit/3)` min 1 capped at 10, `clearDebtToken()` costs 1 BP; getters: `netBP`, `stabilityMalus`). Built budget display composable and wired into header (live BP/income/expenses/net with green/yellow/red color coding) and dashboard (itemized breakdowns per colony/corp/contract/mission, debt warning panel with stability malus).

**Key architecture decisions:**
- Budget store initializes with 10 BP and income from Terra Nova
- Corp tax wiring deferred to Story 6.2 (TODO in store)
- Turn number still hardcoded (wired in Story 12.5)

**Tests:** 174 passing (tax: 21, prior: 153)

## Epic 4: Planets & Colonies — Data Model (Completed 2026-02-17)

Implemented planet generation and colony data structures (Stories 4.1-4.5). Built planet generator (`generatePlanet` — type/size by spawn weight, features from eligible pool with spawn chance, deposits from type's deposit pool with tiered chances and random richness). Built colony generator (`generateColony` — initializes colony from planet + colony type, applies starting infrastructure, registers planet feature modifiers and colony type passive bonus onto `colony.modifiers`, calculates initial attributes via `resolveModifiers()`). Created Pinia stores for planets (`planet.store.ts` — CRUD by ID/status/sector) and colonies (`colony.store.ts` — CRUD with Terra Nova initialization from start-conditions data). Wired colony presence into galaxy store's `explorableSectors` getter. Built Colony List View (`ColoniesView.vue` + `ColonyCard.vue` — clickable cards with attribute bars, growth progress, auto-initialization) and Colony Detail View (`ColonyDetailView.vue` + `AttributePanel.vue`, `InfraPanel.vue`, `ResourceFlow.vue` — two-column layout with modifier breakdown tooltips, infrastructure ownership, deposit/feature display, disabled Invest button).

**Key architecture decisions:**
- Colony generator supports `overrideInfrastructure` for Terra Nova's custom starting state
- Deposit-dependent starting infra only applied if planet has a matching deposit
- Attribute tooltips use `getModifierBreakdown()` for full source attribution
- Invest button disabled until budget system (Story 8.4)
- Shortage alerts deferred to Story 9.2

**Tests:** 153 passing (planet-generator: 25, colony-generator: 27, prior: 101)

---

## Epic 3: Galaxy Generation & Sectors (Completed 2026-02-17)

Implemented galaxy generation and display (Stories 3.1-3.4). Built sector generator (`generateSector` — unique name from pool, density by spawn weight, threat modifier 0.5-1.5) and galaxy generator (`generateGalaxy` — 10-15 sectors, adjacency graph with 2-4 connections per sector, 1-2 bottlenecks, max 5 hops, all reachable). Created Pinia galaxy store with `sectors`, `adjacency`, `startingSectorId`, and getters for adjacent/explorable sectors. Built Galaxy View with sector list (expandable cards showing density, exploration %, adjacency connections, presence indicators), adjacency graph visualization, and summary bar.

**Key architecture decisions:**
- Galaxy generator uses layered approach: spanning tree → bottleneck designation → edge augmentation → constraint validation with retry
- `explorableSectors` getter initially used starting sector as only presence source (colony store wired in Story 4.3, fleet store deferred to Story 15.4)
- Sector cards show green/indigo/gray dots for presence/explorable/unreachable status

**Tests:** 101 passing (sector-generator: 11, galaxy-generator: 16, prior: 74)

## Epic 2: Game Shell & Navigation (Completed 2026-02-17)

Built the application shell (Stories 2.1-2.4). Configured Vue Router with 11 lazy-loaded routes (default `/` → Dashboard). Created collapsible sidebar (AppSidebar.vue) with active route highlighting and top header bar (AppHeader.vue) with placeholder turn/BP/End Turn button. All 11 view scaffolds have styled titles and contextual empty-state messages. Built 9 shared UI components: ProgressBar, AttributeBar, StatCard, ResourceBadge, EventCard, ConfirmDialog, Tooltip, DataTable, EmptyState.

**Key architecture decisions:**
- Dark theme: zinc-950 background, zinc-900 sidebar/header, zinc-800 borders
- Sidebar: 224px expanded / 64px collapsed, indigo accent for active route
- Header values are hardcoded placeholders — wired to stores in Stories 5.3 and 12.5
- All components use Tailwind CSS only, TypeScript typed props

---

## Epic 1: Project Foundation (Completed 2026-02-17)

Scaffolded the Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind CSS project (Stories 1.1-1.5). Established full folder structure matching Structure.md, TypeScript strict mode, and Vitest. Created all type definitions in `src/types/` (15 files: branded IDs, all entity interfaces, `GameState`, `Modifier`, `EmpireBonuses`). Implemented modifier resolver (`resolveModifiers`, `getModifierBreakdown` — additive first, then multiplicative, then clamp). Built 4 utility modules (`random.ts` with seeded PRNG, `math.ts`, `format.ts`, `id.ts` with nanoid). Created 20 static data files in `src/data/` covering all game entities from Data.md.

**Key architecture decisions:**
- `Modifier[]` stored on entities for local per-entity variation; `EmpireBonuses` on `GameState` for global cumulative values (never modifiers)
- `PhaseResult = { updatedState: GameState; events: GameEvent[] }` is the standard return type for all turn phases
- `ColonyInfrastructure` is `Record<InfraDomain, InfraState>` with public/corporate ownership tracked separately
- Engine/data/generators/types/utils never import Vue or Pinia

**Tests:** 74 passing (modifiers: 19, utils: 55)
